            Hello, my name is Shaine. Something that I am passionate about is fitness. I enjoy going to the gym and
            pushing myself to get stronger. I used to work as a personal trainer. It gave me the opportunity to teach
            clients how they can reach their fitness goals. The most difficult part of the job was trying to schedule
            all of my clients. The work hours were also quite difficult. Some days I would start at 5 a.m. and would not
            leave until 8 or 9 p.m. Ultimately, I decided that the job was not the best for me, so I went back to
            college for computer programming.
